# Binary Trees in C

## Project Overview
This project is focused on the implementation and understanding of binary trees in C. It includes various operations such as creation, insertion, deletion, and traversal of binary trees. This project is part of ALX Software Engineering Course and is a collaborative effort between myself and my peers.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand what a binary tree is and how it differs from other tree structures like Binary Search Trees.
- Gain insights into the potential time complexity improvements over linked lists.
- Explore tree characteristics: depth, height, and size.
- Implement different traversal methods for binary trees.
- Understand the distinctions between complete, full, perfect, and balanced binary trees.

## Installation and Usage
- Clone the repository: `git clone git@github.com:DesmondKarani/binary_trees.git`
- Compile the files using gcc: `gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c`
- Run the executable

## Project Structure
- `binary_trees.h`: Header file containing all function prototypes and the basic structure of a binary tree.
- `*.c`: Various C files containing the implementations of binary tree operations.
- `main.c`: Example main file for testing purposes (not included in the final submission).

## Implemented Functions
- `binary_tree_node`: Creates a binary tree node.
- `binary_tree_insert_left`: Inserts a node as the left-child of another node.
- `binary_tree_insert_right`: Inserts a node as the right-child of another node.
- `[Other Functions]`: Description of other functions implemented.
- `binary_tree_print`: Provided function for tree visualization (not part of the project submission).
